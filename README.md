# VulnScout MCP

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes [VulnScout](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/vulnscout)'s VEX assessment and variant-context APIs as tools for LLM agents. It lets an agent read and write vulnerability assessments and variant metadata in VulnScout directly from a chat session.

## Features

- **Write VEX assessments** for a CVE across one or more packages, supporting both OpenVEX and CycloneDX VEX status/justification/response values.
- **Read assessments**, either a single assessment by ID or the full history for a given CVE.
- **Read and update variant context** (deployment environment, platform, objectives profile, notes) by variant UUID or by project/variant name.
- Thin, dependency-light implementation: a single `httpx`-based API client plus a small set of [FastMCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) tool modules.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A running instance of VulnScout, reachable over HTTP

## Getting started

This server speaks MCP over stdio and is meant to be launched by an MCP
client (VS Code, the Copilot CLI, etc.), not run standalone as an HTTP
service. The client starts `run_server.py` as a subprocess per session and
talks to it over stdin/stdout; there is no listening port or long-running
daemon to manage yourself.

### Bootstrap launcher

`run_server.py` is a self-contained launcher: on first run it creates a local
`venv/`, installs `requirements.txt` into it, then execs into the server.
This means an MCP client can point straight at the script without any manual
setup — just clone the repo and configure a client below.

### Configure in VS Code (GitHub Copilot extension)

Add a server entry to your workspace `.vscode/mcp.json` (or run **MCP: Add
Server** from the Command Palette and choose **Workspace**/**Global**):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "vulnscout": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/vulnscout-mcp/run_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:7275"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configure in GitHub Copilot CLI

Either run `/mcp add` in interactive mode and fill in the form (**Type:**
STDIO, **Command:** `python3 /path/to/vulnscout-mcp/run_server.py`,
**Environment Variables:** `{"VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL":"http://localhost:7275"}`),
or add it from the terminal:

```bash
copilot mcp add vulnscout \
  --env VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7275 \
  -- python3 /path/to/vulnscout-mcp/run_server.py
```

Or edit `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vulnscout": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/vulnscout-mcp/run_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:7275"
      },
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Run manually (for development/testing only)

You can invoke the server directly with stdio to exercise it outside a full
MCP client (e.g. with the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector)),
but this is not a supported way to run it in production — it is not an HTTP
server and has no standalone service mode:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7275  # optional, this is the default
python server.py
```

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default                 | Description                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL`  | `http://localhost:7275` | Base URL of the VulnScout API server |

## Available tools

| Tool                          | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `write_assessment`             | Create a VEX assessment for a CVE on one or more packages           |
| `get_assessment`                | Retrieve a single VEX assessment by ID                               |
| `list_assessments_by_vuln`     | List all VEX assessments recorded for a CVE                          |
| `get_variant_context`          | Get context fields for a variant by UUID                             |
| `update_variant_context`       | Update context fields for a variant by UUID (partial updates)       |
| `get_variant_context_by_name`  | Get context fields for a variant by project name and variant name   |

> [!NOTE]
> Every tool returns a plain string: either a formatted summary of the result or an `Error: ...` message. Tools never raise exceptions back to the agent.

## Project structure

```
client.py          VulnScoutClient: httpx wrapper around the VulnScout HTTP API
server.py           Builds the FastMCP server and registers tool modules
run_server.py       Self-bootstrapping launcher (creates venv, installs deps, execs server.py)
tools/
  assessments.py    Tools for reading/writing VEX assessments
  variants.py       Tools for reading/updating variant context
tests/              pytest + respx test suite
```

## Development

Install dependencies (including test-only ones):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the test suite from the repo root:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Run a single test:

```bash
pytest tests/test_assessments.py::TestWriteAssessmentImpl::test_api_error_returns_error_string -q
```
