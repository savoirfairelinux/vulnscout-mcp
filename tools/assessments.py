        Creates a single assessment covering the (package, variant) pairs
        actually observed among the given packages and variants. Pairs that
        no scan recorded are silently skipped, not rejected. The call is
        rejected (and nothing written) only if a package or variant does not
        exist, the variants belong to different projects, or a package is
        observed in none of the given variants. Compare the "N target(s)"
        count in the result with the expected packages x variants to detect
        skipped pairs.
        When ai_generated is true (the default), the write replaces any
        pending AI assessment on the given variants. A pending assessment that
        also covers other variants keeps those and loses only the overlap.
        Only AI assessments are replaced, never custom ones, and the swap is
        atomic: if the write fails, the old assessment is left intact. No
        pre-check with has_ai_assessment is needed.

        Returns a success summary when the API response includes an `assessment`
        object, followed by "; replaced: <id> (<deleted|trimmed>, <variant ids>)"
